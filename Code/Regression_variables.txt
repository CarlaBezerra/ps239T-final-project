Regression Model Variables


#Identifying the variables
# There is no detailed description or code of how each variable was created. So I tried to fit as much as possible the description given in the article with the legend of the variables in the original Spada dataset ("Spadadata.dta").

#For my own new dataset ("PBfinal.csv"), I will not be #able to recreate all variables, specially those related #to city councillors (data was not collected) and some #distance variables, that I'm still studying on how to #calculate.

#Dependent variable

table (data$pb)

### A. Political Variables (POL)

##h1 PT presence

table (data$ptwin)

#considered using ptpow (city council seats controled by the PT, but there might be double count in the governement vulnerability variables)

## h2 Proximity variables

summary(data$mindistno0)

#peerparty missing. I still have to figure out how to make such calculus.

#Spada's description: measure geographical proximity as #the Euclidean distance to the closest city implementing #participatory budgeting in the previous time period, #and peer proximity as a party-network effect. we employ #two alternative measures of party peer effect that #combine ideology and imitation. In the first one a city #is considered to have a peer that has adopted PB if a #city controlled by the same party adopted PB in the #previoustime period. In the second one a weight equal #to the number of cities adopting PB by each party is #applied to the previous dummy variable.

## h3 Economical Variables (ECON)

taxrevenues
financialviability <- data$totexp/data$balsheetrev

##Our hypothesis for h3

data$kapitalrev #total expenditures
capitalinvexp	#capital investment expenditures

capitalratio <- data$capitalinvexp/data$totexp

#Spada's description: (tax share of revenues), 
#and the effect of the city's financial viability (ratio of expenditures and revenues)


#Main doubts about the variables:
# Are all economic variable adjusted for inflation? #Which is the base year? (this is information is #available only for gdp, which uses 2000 as base).
#After checking the source data ate IPEA data, this #remains unclear to me.

## h4 Government Vulnerability

mayorvulnerability <- data$secbestprefeitovote_st/data$votiprefsec #Ratio runnerup/winner votes
legprefpower	#(percentage of city council seats controlled by the mayors party)
continuitypref
continuitypartpref

#Spada's description:
# a) the mayor's party vulnerability (ratio of runner-up votes over mayor's party votes), 
# b) the mayor's party control over the city council (mayor's party shares of seats in the chamber and dummy that identifies if the party of the mayor holds the majority seats), #couln't identify the dummy
# d) continuity of the city government (candidate?).
# e) continuity of the party


## PERIOD

#Author's description: PERIOD is a matrix containing period dummies that capture the effect of time
